## Algorithms 
* Any computing problem can be solved by executing a series of actions in a specific order
* An algorithm describes a procedure for solving a problem in terms of 
  * the actions to execute
  * the order in which these actions execute
* Specifying the order in which statements (actions) execute in a program is called program control

## Pseudocode
* Pseudocode is an informal language for developing algorithms
* Helps you "think out" a program
* Pseudocode normally describes only statements representing the actions, e.g., input, output or calculations
* Carefully prepared pseudocode can be easily converted to a corresponding Java program

## Control Structures
* Sequential execution: normally, statements in a program are executed one after the other in the order in which they are written
* Transfer of control: various Java statements enable you to specify the next statement to execute, which is not necessarily the next one in sequence
* All programs can be written in terms of only three control structures
  * the sequence structure
  * the selection structure
  * the repetition structure

## Sequence Structure
* Unless directed otherwise, computers execute Java statements one after the other in the order in which they're written
* The activity diagram below illustrates a typical sequence structure in which two calculations are performed in order
```java
\\Corresponding Java statement:
total = total + grade;

\\Corresponding Java statement:
counter = counter + 1;
```

## Selection Structure
Three types of selection statements
* if statement
* if..else statement
* switch statement

## Repetition Structure
Three repetition statements (looping statements). Perform statements repeatedly while a loop-continuation condition remains true
* while statement
* for statement
* do..while statement

# if Single-Selection Statement
* Pseudocode
```java
If student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
  Print "Passed"
```
* Java code
```java
if (studentGrade >= 0) 
  system.out.println("Passed");
```

# if..else Double-Selection Statement
* Pseudocode
```
If student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
  Print "Passed"
Else
  Print "Failed"
```
* Java code
```java
if (grade >= 60) 
  system.out.println("Passed");
else
System.out.println( "Failed" );
```

# A More Complex Example
* Pseudocode
```java
If student's grade is greater than or equal to 90
  Print "A"
else
  If student's grade is greater than or equal to 80
    Print "B"
  else
    If student's grade is greater than or equal to 70
      Print "C"
    else
      If student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
        Print "D2"
      else
        Print "F"
```
* Java code
```java
if ( studentGrade >= 90 )
  System.out.println( "A" );
else if ( studentGrade >= 80 )
  System.out.println( "B" );
else if ( studentGrade >= 70 )
  System.out.println( "C" );
else if ( studentGrade >= 60 )
  System.out.println( "D" );
else
  System.out.println( "F" );
```

# while Repetition Statement
* Repeat an action while a condition remains true
* Pseudocode
```java
While there are more items on my shopping list
  Purchase next item and cross it off my list
```
* The repetion statement's body may be single statement or a block. Eventually, the condition should become false, and the repetition terminates, and the first statement after the repetition statement executes (otherwise, endless loop)

## Example
while repetition statement: find the first power of larger then 100
```java
public class powerOf {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int product = 3;
		while (product <= 100) {
			product = product * 3;
		}
    // other statement
  }
}
```

## Will This Progrma Terminate?
```java
public class powerOf {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int product = 3;
		int x;
		while ( product <= 100 ) {
			x = 3 * product;
		}
	}
}
```
No -> Because the local variable x may not have been intialized

# Block Scope
Due to the rule of variable scope, we often define counters before repetition statement
```java
public class blockScope {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int counter = 0;
		while (counter < 10) {
			// do something and increase counter
			// ...
			counter = counter + 1;
		}
		System.out.println("repeated times: "+ counter);
	}
}
```
```
repeated times: 10
```

# Compound Assignment Operators
* Compound assignment operators simplify assignment expressions
* variable = variable operator expression; where operator is one of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` or `%` can be written in the form
```java
variable operator = expression;
```
* `c = c + 3;` can be written as `c += 3;`

# Increment and Decrement Operators
* Unary increment operator, `++`, adds one to its operand
* Unary decrement operator, `--`, subtracts one from its operand
* All increment or decrement operator placed before a variable is called prefix increment or frefix decrement operator
* An increment or decrement operator placed after a variable is called postfix increment or postfix decrement operator
```java
int a = 6;
int b = ++a;
int c = --a;
```

## Preincrementing and Predecrementing
* Using the prfix increment (or decrement) operator to add (or subtract) 1 from a variable is known as preincrementing (or predecrementing) the variable
* Preincrementing (or predecrementing) a variable causes the variable to be incremented (decremented) by 1; then the new value is used in the expression in shich it appears
```java
int a = 6;
int b = ++a; // b gets the value 7
```

### Note the Difference
```java
int b = ++a;
```
Equivalent to:
```java
a = a + 1;
int b = a;
```

```java
int b = a++;
```
Equivalent to:
```java
int b = a;
a = a + 1;
```
In both cases, a becomes 7 after execution, but b gets different values.

### Counter-Controlled Repetition with while
```java
public class WhileCounter {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int counter = 1;
		while (counter <= 10) {
			System.out.print(counter + " ");
			++counter;
		}
		System.out.println();
	}
}
```
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

```

# The for Repetition Statement
* Specifies the counter-controlled-repetition details in a single line of code
```java
public class week02 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
			System.out.print(i + " ");
		}
		System.out.println();
	}
}
```
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

```

# The for and while loop
* in most cases, a for statement can be easily represented with an equivalent while statement
* Typically, for statements are used for counter-controlled repetition and while statements for sentinel-controlled repetition
```java
for(initialization; loop-continuation condition; increment/decrement exp) {
  statement(s);
}
```
```java
initialization;
while(loop-continuation condition) {
  statement(s);
  increment/decrement exp;
}
```

## More on for Repetition Statement
* You might omit the increment if the program calculates it with statements in the loop's body or no increment is needed
```java
for (int i=0; i < 10;) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}
```
```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int input = sc.nextInt();
for (; input > 0;) {
  System.out.println(input);
  input = sc.nextInt();
}
sc.close();
```
* The increment expression in a for acts as if it were a standalone statement at the end of the for's body, so
  ```java
  counter = counter + 1
  counter += 1
  ++counter
  counter++
  ``` 
  are equivalent increment expressions in a for statement
* The initialization and increment/decrement expressions can contain multiple expressions separated by commas
```java
for (int i = 2; i <= 20; total += i, i += 2) {
  System.out.println(total);
}
```
  = 
```java
int total = 0;
for (int i = 2; i <= 20; i += 2) {
  System.out.println(total);
  total += i; // why last line?
}
```

# The do..while repetition statement
* **do..while** is similar to while
* In while, the program tests the loop-continuation condition before executing the loop body; if the condition is false, the loop body never executes
* **do..while** tests the loop-continuation condition after executing the loop body. The loop body always executes at least once.

## Execution flow of do..while
```java
public class doWhile {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int counter = 1;
		do { 
			System.out.println(counter);
			++counter;
		} while (counter <= 10);
	}
}
```

# The switch Multiple-Selection Statement
```java
switch (studentGrade) {
	case 'A':
		System.out.println("90 - 100");
		break;
	case 'B':
		System.out.println("80 - 89");
		break;
	case 'C':
		System.out.println("70 - 79");
		break;
	case 'D':
		System.out.println("60 - 69");
		break;
	default:
		System.out.println("score < 60");
}
```
* The switch statement performs different actions based on the values of an integral expression of type byte, short, int or char etc
* It consists of a block that contains a sequence of case labels and an optional default case
* The program compares the controlling expression's value with each case label
* If a match occurs, the program executes that case's statements
* If no match occurs, the default case executes
* If no match occurs and there is no default case, program simply continues with the first statement after switch

# The break Statement
* The break statement, when executed in a while, for, do..while or switch, causes immediate exit from that statement
* Execution continues with the first statement after the control statement
* Common uses of the break statement are to escape early from a loop or to skip the remainder of a switch
```java
public class breakStatement {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int i;
		for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) { // loop 10 time
			if (i == 5) {
				break;
			}
			System.out.print(i + " ");
		}
		System.out.println("\nBroke out of loop at count = "  + i);
	}
}
```
```
1 2 3 4 
Broke out of loop at count = 5
```

# The continue Statement
* The continue statement, when executed in a shile, for or do..while, skips the remaining statements in the loop body and proceeds with the next iteration of the loop
* In while and do..while statements, the program evaluates the loop-continuation test immediately after the continue statement executes
* In a for statement, the increment expression executes, then the program evaluates the loop-continuation test

```java
public class continueStatement {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int i;
		for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) { // loop 10 time
			if (i == 5) {
				continue; // skip remaining code in the loop if count 5
			}
			System.out.print(i + " ");
		}
		System.out.println("\nUsed continue to skip printing 5" + i);
	}
}
```
```
1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 10
Used continue to skip printing 5
```

# Logical Operators
Help form complex conditions by conditions by combining simple ones:
* `&&` (conditional AND)
* `||` (conditional OR)
* `&` (boolean logical AND)
* `|` (boolean logical OR)
* `Λ` (boolean logical exclusive OR)
* `!` (logical NOT)

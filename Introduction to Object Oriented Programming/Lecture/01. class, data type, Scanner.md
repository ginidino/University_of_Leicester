# Java Applications
Java is widely used in every corner of world and of human life. Java is not only used in sortware's but also widely used in designing hardware controlling software components. 

## Java Features
* Developing Desktop Applications
* Web Applications like Linkedin.com, Snapdeal.com etc
* Moblie Operating System like Android
* Embedded Systems
* Robotics and games etc

## Basic of Java
Print `Hello World`
```java
public class week01 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
```
Output
```
Hello World
```

# Comments
// Text-printing program
* `//` indicates that line is a `comment`
* Comments help document programs to improve their readability
* Compiler ignores comments

Traditional commetns begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can be spread over several lines.
```java
/* This is a traditional comment.
It can be split over multiple lines */
```

## Traditional vs End-of-Line Comments
* Traditional comments do no nest, the first `*/` after the first `/*` will terminate the comment
```java
/*
/* comment 1 */
comment 2 */
```
* End-of-Line comments can contain anything
```java
// /* this comment is okay */
```

# Class Declaration
```java
public class Task1
```
* Every Java program consists of at least one class that defined
* The class keyword introduces a class declaration and is immediately followed by the class name
* keywords are reserved for use by Java and are always splled with all lowercase letters

## Identifiers
* A name in a Java program is called an identifier, which is used for identification purpose
	* Task1 is an identifier. It is the name for the class we just defined
* The only allowed characters in Java identifiers are **a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, $ and _**
* Identifiers can not start with digits, e.g., 123name is invalid

## Class name
* By convention, class names begin with a capital letter and capitalize the first letter of each word they include
* Java is case sensitive uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct (not in comments). *Name* and *name* are different identifier

# The Braces
* A left brace `{` begins the declaration of every class and method
* A corresponding right brace `}` ends the declaration of each class and method
* Code between braces should be indented
```java
public class Task1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!");
	}
}
```

# The main method
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!");
}
```
* Starting point of java applications
* A method groups code that collectively achieves a functionality
* Parentheses after the identifier main enclose formal parameters
* Java class declarations normally contain one or more methods
* Keyword void indicates that this method will not return any data

## The main method body
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!");
}
```
* Enclosed in left and right braces
* The statement in method instructs the computer to print the `string` of characters contained between the double quotation marks

# System.out Object
```java
System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!");
```
* `System.out` is the standard output object that allows Java applications to display strings in the command window
* `System.out.println` method
	* Displays (or prints) a line of text in the command window
	* The string in the parentheses is the actual argument to the method
	* Positions the output cursor at the beginning of the next line in the command window
	
## The newline character
* Newline characters instruct `System.out` print and println methods to position the output cursor at the beginning of the next line in the command window
* Newline characters are white-space characters, which represent horizontal or vertical space in typography and do not correspond to visible marks
```java
System.out.println("Welcome\nto\nJava\nProgramming!");
// The following text will be shown on the console:
```
Output
```
Welcome
to
Java
Programming!
```

## Common Escape Sequences
|Sequence|Description|
|---|---|
|`\n`|Newline. Position the cursor at the beginning of the next line.|
|`\t`|Horizontal tab. Move the cursor to the next tab stop|
|`\r`|Carriage return. Position the cursor at the beginning of the current line (do not advance to the next line). Any characters output after the carriage return overwrite the characters previously output on that line|
|`\\`|Used to print a backslash character|

# Data Types
* All programs are composed of data and operations on the data
* A data type tells the computer how the programmer intends to use the data
	* What is the meaing of the data (a wequence of bits)?
	* What operations can be done on the data?
	* How to store the data in memory?
* Computers only know about a few types of data: `numbers, booleans, characters(string), arrasy, structures(object)`

## Primitive data types
* Complex data types are built from primitive data types, which are built-in and basic to a language implementation
* Java has eight primitive types:
	* Integral types: `byte, short, int, long`
	* Floating-porint types: `float, double`
	* The `boolean` data type
	* The `char` data type
	
### Integral data type (Integer)
|Type|Range|
|---|---|
|byte|-128 to +127|
|short|-32,768 to +32,767|
|int|-2,147,483,648 to o 2,147,483,647|
|long|(about) -10E18 to +10E18|

#### Meaning of int age = 20
The statement tells the computer to
* Allocate space in memory to hold data of int type
* Give the memory location a name "age", such as we can refer to the data stored in the location using the name in the program (we say we created a variable named age)
* Store the value 20 to the allocated space

### Floating-Point Numbers
* Computers represent real numbers(numbers that can contain a fractional part) using complex standard
* The term "floating point" is derived from the fact that there is no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point; that is, the decimal point can float
* There are also fixed-point representations: the number of digits before and after the decimal point is set
|Type|Range|
|---|---|
|float|-3.4E+38 to +3.4E+38|
|double|-1.7E+308 to 1.7E+308|

```java
float y = 133.23f;
double y = 3.1415926;
```

#### The precision of double and float
* The double type: double-precision floating -point number
	* A double has approximately 16 decimal digits
* The float type: single-precision floating number
	* A float has approximately 7 decimal digits
```java
float f = 1.2345678990922222f; // 16 decimal digits
double d = 1.22222222222222222222; // 20 decimal digits
System.out.println("f = " + f + "\t" + "d = " + d);
```
```
f = 1.2345679	d = 1.2222222222222223
```

### The boolean data type
* Represents one bit of information (the real size in memory depends on language implementations, could be 8 bits)
* Has only two possible values: `true` or `false`
* Often used as imple flags for tracking program conditions

Example
```java
boolean testResult = true;
```

##### Question
Why computers cannot store real numbers of infinite precisions (such as the irrational number Ï€)?

Answer: It would otherwise require infinite memory (resources are finite in computers). This is why the built-in primitive types can only represent a range of values.

# Example
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Addition {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int num1 = 0;
		int num2 = 0;
		int sum = 0;
		
		System.out.print("Enter the first integer: ");
		num1 = reader.nextInt();
		
		System.out.print("Enter the second integer: ");
		num2 = reader.nextInt();
		
		sum = num1 + num2;
		System.out.println("Sum is: \t"+ sum);
	}
}
```
```
Enter the first integer: 1
Enter the second integer: 2
Sum is: 	3
```

## Import Declaration
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```
* Helps the compiler locate a class that is used in this grogram
* In java, related classes are grouped into packages
* java.util package provides commonly-used library class. These classes are collectively called Java class library, or Java Application Programming Interface (Java API)

## Variable declaration statement
```java
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
```
* Variable is a storage location, where a value can be stored for use in a program, paired with a symbolic name (an identifier)
* Variables must be declared with a name and a type before use
* A variable name enables the program to access the value of the variable in memory
* A variable type specifies what kind of information is stored at the location in memory

* The Scanner class enables a program to read input data
* The data can come from different sources, such as the keyboard or a file on disk
* Standard input object, `System.in`, enables a program to read input data typed by the user
* The new keyword creates an object
* The assignment operator `=` assign the value on its right to the operand on its left. Here, the input variable will point to the scanner object

## Receiving input with Scanner
```java
System.out.print("Enter the first integer: "); // prompt
int num1 = reader.nextInt(); // read number from user
```
* Prompt is a message that directs the user to take a specific action
* system is a class, why se don't import it like Scanner?
	* Because it belongs to the *java.lang* package, which is imported by default
* Scanner method `nextInt` obtains an integer from the user. The program waits until the user types the number on the keyboard and press the Enter key to submit the number(the method is blocking)
* The result of the call to method nextInt will be assigned to the variable num1 by the `assignment operator =`
* Note that num1's initial value 0 will be replaced by the new value from `reader.nextInt();'

## operation

### Addition operation
```java
sum = num1 + num2;
```
* The computer reads / loads the values of num1 and num2 from memory, adds the two values and stores the result to the memory location represented by sum
* Expressions: Portions of statements that contain calculations

### Precedence of operators
* Precedence specifies the priority of an operator
* `*`, `/` and `%` operators have the same level of precedence
* `+` and `-` have the same level of precedence
* `*`, `/` and `%` have higher precedence than `+` and `-`
* So, in expression 1 + 2 * 5, the multiplication operator will be applied first

### Associativity of operators
* In case there are multiple operators of the same precedence in an expression, their evaluation order is determined by their associativity
* If an expression contains multiple `*`, `/` and `%` operators, they are applied from the left to right
* If an expression contains multiple `+` and `-` operators, they are also applied from the left to right

### Parentheses in expressions
* In java, parentheses operator () has the highest level of precedence
* In expression (1 + 2) * 3, the addition will be done first because of parentheses
* Parentheses have left associativity
* In expression (1 + 2) * (3 + 4), 1 + 2 will be done first
* In case of nested parentheses, the expression in the innermost set of parentheses is evaluated first: ((a + b) * c)

### Conditional expressions
* An expression that can be `true` or `false`
* Conditional expressions involve two types of operators:
	* Equality operators: `==`, `!=`
	* Relational operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
	
# Decision-making statements
* `if selection statement` allows a program to make a decision based on condition's value
```java
if (condition) action;
```
* in the above statement, the actions will be performed only if condition evaluates to true

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Comparison {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

		System.out.print("Enter the first integer: ");
		int num1 = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());
		
		System.out.print("Enter the second integer: ");
		int num2 = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());
		
		if (num1 == num2) 
			System.out.println(num1 + " == " + num2);
		
		if (num1 != num2)
			System.out.println(num1 + " != " + num2);
	}
}
```
```
Enter first integer: 12
Enter second integer: 32
12 != 32
Enter first integer: 15
Enter second integer: 15
15 == 15
```

# Interfaces

# Java Interfaces
* Objects of related classes can be processed polymorphically by responding to the same method call in their own way

* ***What is interface?***: Interfaces define and standardize the way that objects interact with one another
* Interfaces describe a set of methods that can be called on an object, but do not provide concrete implementations for all the methods
* `Differnet classes may implement the interfaces in different ways`
* An interface is often used `when disparate (i.e., unrelated) classes need to share common methods and constants`
  - An interface is a reference type
  - You can create an interface that describes the desired functionality, then implement this interface in any classes that require that runctionality
  - A class can implement any number of interfaces (making objects polymorphic beyond the constraints of single inheritance)
  - When a class impplements an interface, it has an is-a relationship with the interface data type
* Implemnting an interface allows a class to promise certain behaviors, i.e., forming a contract with the outside world. This contract is enforced at build time by the compiler
* Interfaces are useful since they capture similarity between unrelated objects `without forcing a class relationship`

## Declaring Interface
* Like *public* abstract classes, interfaces are typically public type
* A *public* interface must be declared in a .java file with the same name as the interface
  - All fields are implicitly public, static and final
  - All methods declared in an interface are implicitly public abstract
  ```java
  public interface Payable{
    double getPaymentAmount();
  }
  ```
* An interface declaration begnis with the keyword interface and contains only **constants** and **abstract methods**

## Using Interfaces
* To use an interface, concrete class must specify that it implements the interface and must implement each method in the interface with specified signature
* A class that does not implement all the methods of the interface is an abstract class ust be declared abstract
  ```java
  public class Invoice implements Payable {
    // must override and implement the getPaymentAmount() method
  }
  ```
* You can use interface names anywhere you can use any other data type name
* If you define a reference variable whose type is an interface, any object you assign to it must be an instance of a class that implements the interface
  ```java
  Payable payableObject = new Invoice(...);
  ```

### Example: Developing a Payable Hierarchy
* Extend the earlier payroll system to make it able to determine payments for both employees and invoices
  - Classes Invoice and Employee both represent things for which the company must be able to calculate a payment amount
  - We can make both classes implement the Payable interface, so a program can invoke method getPaymentAmount on both Invoice and Employee objects
  - Enables the polymorphic processing of Invoices and Employees 
    ```java
    public interface Payable{
      double getPaymentAmount();
    }
    ```
#### The UML Class Diagram
<img width="336" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-02 at 2 31 47 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94044443/235681351-ff0704e7-a606-4447-87dc-ff6a69dd5c6a.png">

* The UML expresses the relationship between a class and an interface as realization
* A subclass inherits its superclass's realization relationships

#### Interface Payable
* Interface methods are always public and abstract, so they do not need to be explicitly declared as such
* Interfaces can have any number of methods (no implementation is allowed)
* Interfaces may also contain fields that are implicitly final and static

#### Class Invoice
* Java does not allow subclasses to inherit from more than one superclass, but it allows a class to inherit from one superclass and implement as many interfaces as it needs
* To implement more than one interface, use a comma-separated list of interface names after keyword implements in the class declaration, as in:
  ```java
  public class ClassName extends SuperclassName implements FirstInterface, SecondInterface, ...
  ```
```java
public class Invoice implements Payable {
	private String partNumber;
	private String partDescription;
	private int quantity;
	private double pricePerItem;

	// four-argument constructor
	public Invoice(String part, String description, int count, double price) {
		partNumber = part;
		partDescription = description;
		setQuantity(count); // validate and store quantity
		setPricePerItem(price); // validate and store price per item
	} // end four-argument Invoice constructor

	// set part number
	public void setPartNumber(String part) {
		partNumber = part;
	} // end method setPartNumber

	// get part number
	public String getPartNumber() {
		return partNumber;
	} // end method getPartNumber

	// set description
	public void setPartDescription(String description) {
		partDescription = description;
	} // end method setPartDescription

	// get description
	public String getPartDescription() {
		return partDescription;
	} // end method getPartDescription

	// set quantity
	public void setQuantity(int count) {
		quantity = (count < 0) ? 0 : count; // quantity cannot be negative
	} // end method setQuantity

	// get quantity
	public int getQuantity() {
		return quantity;
	} // end method getQuantity

	// set price per item
	public void setPricePerItem(double price) {
		pricePerItem = (price < 0.0) ? 0.0 : price; // validate price
	} // end method setPricePerItem

	// get price per item
	public double getPricePerItem() {
		return pricePerItem;
	} // end method getPricePerItem

	// return String representation of Invoice object
	public String toString() {
		return String.format("%s: \n%s: %s (%s) \n%s: %d \n%s: $%,.2f", "invoice", "part number", getPartNumber(),
				getPartDescription(), "quantity", getQuantity(), "price per item", getPricePerItem());
	} // end method toString

	// method required to carry out contract with interface Payable
	public double getPaymentAmount() {
		return getQuantity() * getPricePerItem(); // calculate total cost
	} // end method getPaymentAmount
} // end class Invoice
```

#### Class Employee
* When a class implements an interface, it makes a contract with the java compiler:
  - The class will implement each of the methods in the interface or that the class will be declared abstract
  - If the latter, we do not need to declare the interface methods as abstract in the abstract class (they are already implicitly declared as such in the interface)
  - Any concrete subclass of the abstract class must implement the interface methods to fulfill the contract (the nufulfilled contract is inherited)
  - If the subclass does not do so, it too must be declared abstract
```java
public abstract class Employee implements Payable {
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;
	private String socialSecurityNumber;

	public Employee(String first, String last, String ssn) {
		firstName = first;
		lastName = last;
		socialSecurityNumber = ssn;
	}

	public void setFirstName(String first) {
		firstName = first;
	}

	public String getFirstName() {
		return firstName;
	}

	public void setLastName(String last) {
		lastName = last;
	}

	public String getLastName() {
		return lastName;
	}

	public void setSocialSecurityNumber(String ssn) {
		socialSecurityNumber = ssn;
	}

	public String getSocialSecurityNumber() {
		return socialSecurityNumber;
	}

	public String toString() {
		return String.format("%s %s\nsocial security number: %s", getFirstName(), getLastName(),
				getSocialSecurityNumber());
	}

}
```

#### Class SalariedEmployee
* The `SalariedEmployee` class that extends `Employee` must fulfill superclass Employee's contract to implement `Payable` method `getPaymentAmount`
```java
public class SalariedEmployee extends Employee {
	private double weeklySalary;

	public SalariedEmployee(String first, String last, String ssn, double salary) {
		super(first, last, ssn); // pass to Employee constructor
		setWeeklySalary(salary); // validate and store salary
	} // end four-argument SalariedEmployee constructor

	public void setWeeklySalary(double salary) {
		weeklySalary = salary < 0.0 ? 0.0 : salary;
	} // end method setWeeklySalary

	public double getWeeklySalary() {
		return weeklySalary;
	} // end method getWeeklySalary

	public double getPaymentAmount() {
		return getWeeklySalary();
	} 
	
	public String toString() {
		return String.format("salaried employee: %s\n%s: $%,.2f", super.toString(), "weekly salary", getWeeklySalary());
	} // end method toString
} // end class SalariedEmployee
```

#### SalariedEmployee and Invoice
* Objects of a class (or its subclasses) that implements an interface can also be considered as objects of the interface type
* Thus, just as we can assign the reference of a `SalariedEmployee` object to a superclass `Employee` variable, we can assign the reference of a `SalariedEmployee` object to an interface `Payable` variable
* `Invoice` implements `Payable`, so an `Invoice` object is also a `Payable` object, and we can assign the reference of an `Invoice` object to a `Payable` variable
```java
public class PayableInterfaceTest {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		// create four-element Payable array
		Payable payableObjects[] = new Payable[4];

		// populate array with objects that implement Payable
		payableObjects[0] = new Invoice("01234", "seat", 2, 375.00);
		payableObjects[1] = new Invoice("56789", "tire", 4, 79.95);
		payableObjects[2] = new SalariedEmployee("John", "Smith", "111-11-1111", 800.00);
		payableObjects[3] = new SalariedEmployee("Lisa", "Barnes", "888-88-8888", 1200.00);

		System.out.println("Invoices and Employees processed polymorphically:\n");

		// generically process each element in array payableObjects
		for (Payable currentPayable : payableObjects) {
			// output currentPayable and its appropriate payment amount
			System.out.printf("%s \n%s: $%,.2f\n\n", currentPayable.toString(), "payment due",
					currentPayable.getPaymentAmount());
		} // end for
	} // end main
} // end class PayableInterfaceTest
```

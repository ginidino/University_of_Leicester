# Arrays
* Data sturcture: a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification
* An array (a widely-used data structure) is a group of elements containing values of the same type
* Arrays are objects, so they're considered reference types
* Array elements can be either primitive types or reference type

## Referring to Arrays Elements
* The first element in every array has index zero
* An index must be a nonnegative integer
* A program can use an expression as an index (c[1 + a])
* The heighest index in an array is *the number of elements - 1*
* Array names follow the same conventions as other variable name (Lower Camel Case)
* Array-access expressions can be used on the left side of an assignment to place a new value into an array element (c[1] = 2)

## Array Length
* Every array object knows its own length and stores it in a length instance variable(c.length)
* Even though the length instance variable of an array is public, it cannot be changed because it's a final variable (the keyword final creates constants)

## Declaring and Creating Arrays
* Like other objects (recall the usage of Scanner), arrays are created with the keyword new
* To create an array, you specify the type of the array elements and the number of elements as part of an array-creation expression:
  ```java
  int[] c = new int [12];
  ```
  Returns a reference (representing the memory address of the array) that can be stored in an array variable

```java
int[] c = new int [12];
```
* The square brackets following the type int indicate that the variable c will refer to an array
* When type of the array and the square brackets are combined at the beginning of the declaration, all the indentifiers in the declaration are array variables
  ```java
  int[] a, b = new int[10];
  System.out.println(b.length);
  ```
* A program can declare arrays of an type
* Every element of a primitive-type array contains a value of the array's declared element type
* Similarly, in an array of a reference type, every element is a reference to an object of the array's declared element type

## Default Initialization
```java
public class array {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] array; // declare an array named array, array is null here
		array = new int[10]; // create the array object
		System.out.println("Index\t" + "Value"); // output each array element's value
		for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++) {
			System.out.println(counter + "\t" + array[counter]);
		}
	}
}
```
```
Index	Value
0	    0
1	    0
2	    0
3	    0
4	    0
5	    0
6	    0
7	    0
8	    0
9	    0
```
* You can create an array and initialize its elements with an array initializer a comma-separated list of expressions enclosed in braces
  ```java
  int[] n = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
  ```
  * Compiler counts the number of values in the list to determine the size of the array, then sets up the appropriate new operation "behind the scenes"
  * Element n[0] is initialized to 10, n[1] is initialized to 20, and so on

# Initializing Elements One by One
```java
public class InitArray {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] array = new int[5]; // calculate value for each array element
		for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++) {
			array[counter] = 2 + 2 * counter;
		}
		System.out.println("Index\t" + "Value"); // output each array element's value
		
		for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++) {
			System.out.println(counter + "\t" + array[counter]);
		}
	}
}
```
```
Index Value
0	    2
1	    4
2	    6
3	    8
4	    10
```

# Enhanced for Statement
```java
for (parameter : arrayName) {
  statement(s)
}
```
```java
for (int num : numbers) {
  total += num;
}
```
* Iterates through the elements of an array without using a counter, thus avoiding the possibility of "stepping outside" the array
  * parameter has a type and an identifier
  * arrayName is the array through which to iterate
  * Parameter type must be consistent with the type of the elements in the array
* Often used to replace counter-controlled for statement when the code requires access only to element values
  ```java
  for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    total += numbers[i];
  }
  ```
  ```java
  for (int num : numbers) {
    total += num;
  }
  ```
> Note: Cannot be used to modify element values

# Twoo-Dimensional Arrays
* Arrays that we have considered up to now are one-dimensional arrays: a single line of elements
* Data in real life often come in the form of a table

* The table can be represented using a two-dimensional array in Java
* 2D arrays are indexed by two subscripts: one for the row number, the other for the column number
<img width="125" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 4 09 14 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94044443/234321408-01c44832-b9ad-47b1-b66d-72bc5db45eac.png">

```java
gradbook[ 1 ][ 2 ] = 44
gradbook[ 0 ][ 2 ] = 95
gradbook[ 2 ][ 2 ] = ?
```
gradbook[ 2 ][ 2 ] = 65

## 2D Array Details (Similar to 1D Array)
* Similar to 1D array, each element in a 2D array should be of the same type: either primitive type or reference type
* Array access expression (subscripted variables) can be used just like a normal variable: `gradbook[ 1 ][ 2 ] = 44;`
* Array indices (subscripts) must be of type int, can be a literal, a variable, or an expression: `gradebook[1][j], gradebook[i + 1][j + 1]`
* If an array element does not exist, JVM will throw an exception `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException`

## Declaring and Creating 2D Arrays
```java
int[][] gradebook;
```
* Declares a variable that references a 2D array of int
  ```java
  gradebook = new int[50][6]
  ```
* Creates a 2D array (50-by-6 array) with 50 rows (for 50 students) and 6 columns (for 6 tests) and assign the referecne to the new array to the variable gradebook
* Shortcut:
  ```java
  int[][] gradebook = new int[50][6]
  ```

## Array Initialization
* Similar to 1D array, we can create a 2D array and initialize its elements with nested array initializer as follows
  ```java
  int[][] a = { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 } };
  ```
* In 2D arrays, rows can have different lengths (ragged arrays)
  ```java
  int[][] a = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}, {0}};
  ```

> Note that the compiler will "smartly" determine the number of rows and columns

## Under the Hood
* A 2D array is a 1D array of (references to) 1D arrays
  ```java
  int[][] a = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}, {0}};
  ```
* What is the value of a[0]?
  * Answer: The reference (memory address) to the 1D array 1, 2, 3, 4 
* What is the value of a.length?
  * Answer: 4, the number of rows
* What the value of a[1].length? 
  * Answer: 2, the second row only has 2 columns

### Declaring and Creating 2D Arrays
* Since a 2D array is a 1D array of (references to) 1D arrays, a 2D array in which each row has a different number of columns can also be created as follows:
  ```java
  int[][] b = new int[ 2 ][ ]; // create 2 rows
  b[ 0 ] = new int[ 5 ]; // create 5 columns for row 0
  b[ 1 ] = new int[ 3 ]; // create 3 columns for row 1
  ```
  
### Displaying Element values
```java
public class twoD {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[][] a = { { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, { 5, 6 }, { 7, 8, 9 }, { 0 } };
		for (int row = 0; row < a.length; row++) { // loop through columns
			for (int column = 0; column < a[row].length; column++) {
				System.out.print(a[row][column] + " ");
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}
}
```
```
1 2 3 4 
5 6 
7 8 9 
0 
```

# Polymorphism

# Polymorphism in OOP
* In java, **polymorphism** is the ability of an object to take on many forms
* Objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface. Each type can provide its own, independent implementation of this interface
* **Example**: Suppose we create a program that simulates the movement of serveral type of animals for a biological study. Classes *Fish, Frog* and *Bird* represent three types of animals under study
* Each class extends superclass Animal, which contains a method move and maintains an animals's current location as x-y coordinates. Each subclass implements (overrides) method move
```java
Animal[] animals = prepareAnimals();
for(Animal a : Animals) {
  a.move();
}
```
A fish might swim 3 feet
A frog might jump 5 feet
A bird might fly 10 feet

* An object of subclass can be treated as an object of the superclass
* Relying on each object to know how to "do the right thing" in response to the same method call is the key concept of **polymorphism**
* The same message sent to a variety of objects has "many forms" of results, hence the term polymorphism
* Polymorphism enables you to write programs to `process objects that share the same superclass as if they’re all objects of the superclass`
* With polymorphism, we can design and implement *extensible* systems
  - `New classes can be added with little or no modification to the general portions of the program`, as long as the new classes are part of the inheritance hierarchy that the program processes generically
  - The only parts of a program that must be altered to accommodate new classes are those that require direct knowledge of the new classes (e.g., the part that creates the corresponding objects)

## Polymorphism behaivor
* In Java, we can also aim a superclass reference at a subclass object (`the most common use of polymorphism`) 
  ```java
  CommissionEmployee employee = new BasePlusCommissionEmployee(...);
  ```
  This is totally fine due to this is-a relationship (an instance of the subclass is also an instance of superclass)
  ```java
  BasePlusCommissionEmployee employee = new CommissionEmployee(...);
  ```
  This will not compile, the is-a relationship only applies up the class hierarchy
  
* Then the question comes
  ```java
  CommissionEmployee employee = new BasePlusCommissionEmployee(...);
  double earnings = employee.earnings();
  ```
  Question: Which version of earnings() will be invoked? The one in the superclass or the one overridden by the subclass?
* Which method is called is determined by the type of the referenced object, not the type of the variable
* When a superclass variable contains a reference to a subclass object, and that reference is used to call a method, the subclass version of the method is called

## Concrete Classes
* All classes we have defined so far provide implementations of every method they declare (some of the implementations can be inherited)
* They are called "concrete classes"
* Concrete classes can be used to instantiate objects

## Abstract Classes
* Sometimes it's useful to declare "incomplete" class for which you never intend to create objects
* Used only as uperclasses in inheritance hierarchies
* They are called "abstract class",, cannot be used to instantiate objects
* Subclasses must declare the "missing pieces" to become "concrete" classes, from which you can instantiate objects; otherwise, these subclasses, too, will be abstract
* An abstract class provides a superclass from which other classes can inherit and thus share a common design. Not all hierarchies contain abstract class
* Programmers often write client code that uses only abstract superclass types to reduce client code's dependencies on a range of subclass type (i.e., program in general not in specific)

## Declaring Abstract Classes
* You make a class abstract by declaring it with keyword *abstract*
* An abstract class normally contains one or more *abstract methods*, which are declared with the keyword *abstract* and provides no implementations
```java
public abstract class Animal {
  public abstract void move();
    // ...
}
```

## Abstract Method
* Abstract methods have the same visibility rules as normal methods, except that they cannot be private
* Private abstract methods make no sense since abstract methods are intended to be overridden by subclasses
* Abstract methods have no implementations because the abstract classes are too general and only specify the common interfaces of subclasses
  - Think about this: How can an Animal class provide an appropriate implementation for move() method without knowing the specific type of the animal? Every type of animal moves in a different way
    ```java
    public abstract class Animal {
      public abstract void move();
    }
    ```
* A class that contains abstract methods must be declared as abstract even if that class contains some concrete methods
* If a subclass does not implement all abstract methods it inherits from the superclass, the subclass must also be declared as abstract and thus cannot be used to instantiate objects
  - Using abstract classes addresses our earlier problem "the Frog class does not override Animal’s move() method to define specific behaviors of frogs"
* Constructors and static methods cannot be declared abstract (constructors are not inherited, non-private static methods are inherited but cannot be overridden)
* Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to declare variables
* Abstract superclass variables can hold references to objects of any concrete class derived from them
  ```java
  Animal animal = new Frog(...); // assuming Animal is abstract
  ```
* Such practice is commonly adopted to manipulate objects polymorphically
* Note that we can use abstract superclass names to invoke static methods declared in those abstract superclasses (this is also a reason why static methods cannot be abstract)

### Case Study: A Payroll System Using Polymorphism
* The company pays its four types of employees on a weekly basis
  - **Salaried employees** get a fixed weekly salary regardless of working hours
  - **Hourly employees** are paid for each hour of work and receive overtime pay (i.e., 1.5x their hourly salary rate) for after 40 hours worked
  - **Commission employees** are paid a percentage of their sales.
  - **Salaried-commission** employees get a base salary + a percentage of their sales
  - For the current pay period, the company has decided to reward salariedcommission employees by adding 10% to their base salaries. The company wants to write a Java application that performs its payroll calculations polymorphically

## Assignments Between Superclass and Subclass Variables
* Assigning a superclass object's reference to a superclass variable is **natural**
* Assigning a subclass object's reference to a subclass variable is **natural**
* Assigning a subclass object's reference to a superclass variable is **safe**, because the subclass object is also an object of tis superclass (Java objects are polymorphic)
  - the superclass variable can be used to refer only to superclass members
  - If a program refers to subclass-only members through the superclass variable, the comiler reprots errors
* Attempting to assign a superclass object's reference to a subclass variable is a compilation error
* To avoid this error, the superclass object's reference must be cast to a subclass type explicitly
* At execution time, if the object to which the reference refers is not a subclass object, an exception will occur
* Use the ***instanceOf**** operator to ensure that such a cast is performed only if the object is subclass object

## fianl Method and Static Binding
* A **final method** in a superclass cannot be overridden in an subclass. You might want to make a method final if it has an implementation that should not be changed and it is critical to the consistent state of the ojbect
* `private methods are implicitly final.` it's not possible to override them in a subclass (not inherited)
* `static methods are implicitly final.` Non-private static methods are inherited by subclasses, but cannot be overridden (they are final). They are hidden if the subclass defines a static method with the same signature
* A final method's declaration can never change and therefore calls to final methods are resolved at compile time, known as **staic binding**

```java
public class TestFinalMethod {
  public static void test() {
    System.out.println("hello from superclass");
    }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    TestFinalMethod obj = new TestFinalMethod2();
    obj.test(); // which test will be called?
  }
}

class TestFinalMethod2 extends TestFinalMethod {
  public static void test() { // this is hiding, not overriding
    System.out.println("hello from subclass");
  }
}
```
Output
```
hello from superclass
```

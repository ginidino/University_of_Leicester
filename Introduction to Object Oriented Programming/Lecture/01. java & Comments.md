	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
```

```

## Comments
// Text-printing program
* `//` indicates that line is a `comment`
* Comments help document programs to improve their readability
* Compiler ignores comments

Traditional commetns begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can be spread over several lines.
```java
/* This is a traditional comment.
It can be split over multiple lines */
```

### Traditional vs End-of-Line Comments
* Traditional comments do no nest, the first `*/` after the first `/*` will terminate the comment
```java
/*
/* comment 1 */
comment 2 */
```
* End-of-Line comments can contain anything
```java
// /* this comment is okay */
```

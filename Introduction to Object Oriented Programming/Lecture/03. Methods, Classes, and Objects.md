# Methods, Classes, and Objects

## Example: Problem Soving
Find the sum of integers from 1 to 10, from 20 to 30, and from 35 to 45, respectively.
```java
public class sumOfIntegers {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
			sum += i;
		}
		System.out.println("Sum from 1 to 10 is " + sum);
		
		sum = 0;
		for (int i = 20; i <= 30; i++) {
			sum += i;
		}
		System.out.println("Sum from 20 to 30 is " + sum);
		
		sum = 0;
		for (int i = 35; i <= 45; i++) {
			sum += i;
		}
		System.out.println("Sum from 35 to 45 is " + sum);
	}
}
```
```
Sum from 1 to 10 is 55
Sum from 20 to 30 is 275
Sum from 35 to 45 is 440
```

* Using method
```java
public class SummationSolution {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Sum from 1 to 10 is " + Summation(1, 10));
		System.out.println("Sum from 20 to 30 is " + Summation(20, 30));
		System.out.println("Sum from 35 to 45 is " + Summation(35, 45));
	}
	
	public static int Summation(int n1, int n2) {
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = n1; i <= n2; i++) {
			sum += i;
		}
		return sum;
	}
}
```
```
Sum from 1 to 10 is 55
Sum from 20 to 30 is 275
Sum from 35 to 45 is 440
```

# Methods
* Methods facilitate the design, implementation, operation and maintenance of large programs
  ```java
  public class NumberGuessing {
	  public static void main(String[] args) {
		  Random random = new Random();
		  int magicNum = random.nextInt(10);
		  System.out.println(magicNum);
	  }
  }
  ```
* Static methods can be called without the need for an object of the class to exist
  ```java
  public class week03 {
  	public static void main(String[] args) {
  		double x1 = 3.14, y1 = -2.98;
  		double x2 = -2.71, y2 = 7.15;
  		System.out.println("The distance of the two points is " + Math.pow(Math.pow(x2 - x1, 2) + Math.pow(y2 - y1, 2), 0.5));
  	}
  }
  ```

## Why Use Methods?
* For reusable code, reducing code duplication
* To parameterize code
* For top-down programming (divide and conquer)
* To create conceptual units
* To simplify
* To ease debugging and maintenance

## Program Modules in Java
* Java programs are written by combining new methods and classes that you write with predefined methods and classes avaiable in the framework and in various 3rd party libraies
* Related classes are typically grouped into packages so that they can be imported into programs and reused
* The Java API provides a rich collection of predifined classes(e.g., java.util.Scanner, java.lang.Math)
* A method is invoked by a method call
* When the called method (the callee) completes its task, it can return to the calling method (the caller):
  * Nothing (void, simply returning control back)
  * Primitive values (e.g., an integer)
  * References to objects, arrays

## static Methods
* Sometimes a method performs a task that does not depend on the contents of any object
  * Method applies to the class in which it's declared
  * Knowsn as a static method or class method
  * Has the keyword static before the return type in the declaration
  * Called via the class name and a dot(.) separator

## Details of Methods
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MaximumFinder {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.print("enter first values: ");
		double num1 = Double.parseDouble(reader.nextLine());
		System.out.print("enter second values: ");
		double num2 = Double.parseDouble(reader.nextLine());
		System.out.print("enter third values: ");
		double num3 = Double.parseDouble(reader.nextLine());
		
		double result = maximum(num1, num2, num3);
		
		System.out.println();
		System.out.println("max is " + result);
	}
	
	public static double maximum(double x, double y, double z) {
		double max = x;
		if (y > max) {
			max = y;
		}
		if (z > max) {
			max = z;
		}
		return max;
	}
}
```
* Before any method can be called, its arguments must be evaluated to determine their values
* If an argument is a method call, the method call must be performed to determine its return value

## Returning Results
* If the method does not return a result, control returns when the program flow reaches the method-ending right brace
* Or when the statement return; executes
* If the method returns a result, the statement
  * return expression;
  evaluates the expression, then returns the result to the caller
  
## Passing Arguments
* Typically two ways: pass-by-value and pass-by-reference
* When an argument is passed by value, a copy of the argument's value is passed to the called method
  * The called method works exclusively with the copy
  * Changes to the copy do not affect the original variable's value in the caller
* When an argument is passed by reference (memory location), the called method can directly access the argument's value in the caller and modify that data, if necessary
  * Improves performance by avoiding copying possibly large amounts of data

## Pass-by-value in Java
* In Java, all arguments are passed by value
* A method call can pass two types of values to the called method: copies of primitive values and copies of references to objects
* Although an object's reference is passed by value, a method can still interact with the referenced object using the copy of the object's reference (arrays are also objects)
  * The parameter in the called method and the argument in the calling method refer to the same object in memory

### Example
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  int a = 3;
  System.out.println("Before: " + a);
  triple(a);
  System.out.println("After: " + a);
}
public static void triple(int x) {
  x *= 3;
}
```
Output
```
Before: 3
After: 3
```

```java
public class example {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] a = { 1, 2, 3 };
		System.out.println("Before: ");
		
		for (int value : a) {
			System.out.print(value + " ");
		}
		triple(a);
		System.out.println();
		
		System.out.println("After: ");
		for (int value : a) {
			System.out.print(value + " ");
		}
	}
	
	public static void triple(int[] x) {
		for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
			x[i] *= 3;
		}
	}
}
```
Output
```
Before:
1 2 3
After:
3 6 9
```

## Argument Promotion
* The process of converting an argument's value, if possible, to the type that the method expects to receive in its corresponding parameter
* `Math.sqrt()` expects to receives a double argument, but it is ok to write `Math.sqrt(4)`: java converts the int value 4 to the double value 4.0

### Promotion Rules
Specify wich conversions are allowed (which conversions can be performed without losing data)

|Type|Valid promotions|
|---|---|
|double|None|
|float|double|
|long|float or double|
|int|long, float or double|
|char|int, long, float or double|
|short|int, long, float or double|
|byte|short, int, long, float or double|
|boolean|None(boolean values are not considered to be numbers in Java)|

Besides arguments passed to methods, the ruels also apply to expressions containing values of two or more primitive types
```java
2 * 2.0 becomes 4.0
int x = 2;
double y = x * 2.0;
// is x 2.0 or 2 now?
```
-> x is still of int type, the expression uses a temporary copy of x's value for promotion

## Method Overloading
* Methods of the same name can be declared in the same class, as long as they have different sets of parameters
* Used to create serveral methods that perform the same/similar tasks on different types or different numbers of arguments
  * Java compiler selects the appropriate method to call by examining the number, types and order of the arguments in the call
  ```java
  public static double max(double a, double b)
  public static float max(float a, float b)
  public static int max(int a, int b)
  public static long max(long a, long b)
  ```
* Compiler distinguishes overloaded methods by their signature
  * A combination of the method's name and the number, types and order of its parameters
  ```java
  public double calculateAnswer(double wingSpan, int numberOfEngines, double length, double grossTons) {
    // do the calculation here
    return 0.0;
  }
  ```
* Method calls cannot be distinguished by return type. If you have overloaded methods only with different return types:
  * `int square(int a)`
  * `double square(int a)`
* and you called the method as follows:
  * `square(2);`
* The compiler will be confused (since return value ignored)

## Variale-Length Argument Lists
* With variable-length argument lists, you can create methods that receive an unspecified number of arguments
* A type followed by an ellipsis (...) in a method's parameter list indicates that the method receives a variable number of arguments of that particular type
  * *public static double average(double... numbers)
  * Can occur only once in a parameter list, and the ellipsis, together with its type, must be placed at the end of the parameter list
* Java treats the variable-length argument list as an array of the specified type

### Example
```java
public class VariableLength {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		double d1 = 10.0, d2 = 20.0, d3 = 30.0;
		System.out.println("average of d1 and d2: " + average(d1, d2));
		System.out.printf("average of d1 ~ d3: " + average(d1, d2, d3));
	}

	public static double average(double... numbers) {
		double total = 0.0;
		for (double d : numbers) {
			total += d;
		}
		return total / numbers.length;
	}
}
```
Output
```
average of d1 and d2: 15.0
average of d1 ~ d3: 20.0
```

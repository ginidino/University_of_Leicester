# Object-Oriented Programming
* Each Java program consists of one or more classes
* Each class represnts type of objects (e.g., those in the physical world such as a car and printer)
* Objects interact with each other for computation
* Three key concepts: **class, object, method**

## Example: The Car Driving Analogy
Example: Suppose that our computational task is to drive a car and accelerate it by pressing down on its accelerator pedal.

### The Car Driving Analogy
* **The very first step**: Before you can drive a car, someone has to desing it
* The car's blueprints should also include the design for an accelerator pedal
* A lot of other components should also be design, e.g., the brake pedal, the steering wheel

### The Car Driving Analogy
* We cannot drive a car's engineering drawings
* Before we drive a car, it must be `built from the engineering drawings`
* Even building a car is not enough, the driver must `press the accelerator pedal` to perform the task of driving the car

### Detailed Analysis
* When programming in Java, we begin by creating a program unit called class, just like we gegin with engineering draws in the friving example
* In a class, we provide one or more **methods** that are designed to perform the class's
* Methods hide from users the complex tasks that they perform, just like the accelerator pdeal of a car hides from the driver the complex mechanisms that make the car move faster
* We cannot drive a car's engineering drawings. Similarly, we cannot "drive" a class to perform a task
* Just as we have to build a car from its engineering drawings before driving it, we must build an **object** of a class before getting the program to perform tasks

* When driving a car, pressing the accelerator pedal sends a **message** to the car to **perform a task**-make the car go faster.
* Similarly, we send a message to an object by a method call to tell the method of the object to perform its task.

### Instance Variables
* A car can have many **attributes**: its color, the amount of gas in its tank, its current speed, and the total miles driven.
* These attributes are represented as part of a car’s design.
* As you drive a car, **these attributes are always associated with the car** (not other cars of the same model).
* Every car maintains its own attributes (e.g., knowing how much gas is left in its tank, but do not know about other cars).
* Similarly, an object has attributes that are carried with the object as it’s used in a program.
* These attributes are specified as the class’s **instance variables**.
* For example, a bank account object has a balance attribute that represents the amount of money in that account.

### The Whole Picture
* **Class**: a car’s engineering drawings (a blueprint).
* **Method**: designed to perform tasks (making a car move).
* **Object**: the car we drive.
* **Method call**: perform the task (pressing the accelerator pedal).
* **Instance variable**: to specify the attributes (the amount of gas).

## Declaring a Class
Every class declaration contains the keyword **calss + the class's name**
```java
public class GradeBook {
// every class' body is enclosed in a pair of
// left and right curly braces
}
```
The **access modifier public** indicates that the declared class is visible to all classes everywhere

A class usually consists of one or more methods
* **Method = Method header + Method body** (enclosed by {})
```java
public class GradeBook {
  // display welcome message to the user
  public void displayMessage() {
    System.out.println("Welcome to the Grade Book!");
  }
}
```

## Declaring a Method
The return type specifies the type of data the method returns after performing its task, `void` means returning nothing to its calling method
```java
public class GradeBook {
  // display welcome message to the user
  public void displayMessage() {
    System.out.println("Welcome to the Grade Book!");
  }
}
```
The **access modifier public** indicates that the method is "avaliable to public", that is, can be called from the methods of other classes

By convention, **method names** are in **Lower Camel Case**: the initial letter is in lower case, subwequent words begin with a capital letter
```java
public class GradeBook {
  // display welcome message to the user
  public void displayMessage() {
    System.out.println("Welcome to the Grade Book!");
  }
}
```
The parentheses enclose the information that the method requires to perform its task. Empty parentheses indicate no information needs

Like class, the method body is also enclosed in {}. The method body contains statements that perform the method's task
```java
public class GradeBook {
  // display welcome message to the user
  public void displayMessage() {
    System.out.println("Welcome to the Grade Book!");
  }
}
```
Tips:
1. Don't forget the ; after a statement
2. try to use meaningful names when declaring a method to make your programs understandable

## Object Creation and Method Calling
```java
public class GradeBookTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // create a GradeBook object
    // assign it to myGradeBook
    GradeBook myGradeBook = new GradeBook();
    
    // call myGradeBook's displayMessage method
    myGradeBook.displayMessage();
  }
}
```
* Define a variable of the type `GradeBook`. Note that each new class you create becomes a new data type. Java is an extensible language
* **Class instance creation expression.** The keyword `new` is used to create a new object of the specified class. Class name + () represent a call to a `constructor` (a special method used to initialize the object's data)
* We can use the variable `myGradeBook` to refer to the created object and call the method `displayMessage()` using the member operator ".". Empty parentheses indicate that we provide no data to the called method

## Method Parameters
Sometimes a method needs additional information to perform its task. Parameters are for this purpose
```java
public class GradeBook {
  // display welcome message to the user
  public void displayMessage( String courseName ) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to the Grade Book for the course "+ courseName);
  }
}
```

## Method Call with Arguments
```java
public class GradeBookTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    GradeBook myGradeBook = new GradeBook();
    myGradeBook.displayMessage("Java Programming");
  }
}
```
* here when calling the method displayMessage, we supply a value for the parameter courseName. We call such values arguments
* (Parameter vs Argument) 
  * A parameter is the variable that is part of the method's declaration. 
  * An argument is an expression used when calling the method

## More on Instance Variables
* An object has **attributes (e.g., the amount of gas of a car)** that are carried with the object as it is used in a program
* Such attributes exist before a method is called on an object and after the method completes execution
* A class typically consists of one or more **method** that **manipulate the attributes** of a particular object of the class

```java
public class GradeBook {
  private String courseName;
  
  public void displayMessage( String courseName ) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to the Grade Book for the course "+ courseName);
  }
}
```
* Object attributes are represented as variables (called `fields`) in a class declaration
* Each object (instance) of the class has its own copy of an attribute in memory, the `field` that represents the attribute is also know as an `instance variable`

## Local variables vs Instance variables
```java
public class GradeBookTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    GradeBook myGradeBook = new GradeBook();
    myGradeBook.displayMessage("Java Programming");
  }
}
```
* Variables declared in the body of a particular method are known as `local variables` and can be only used in that method
* `Instance variables` are declared inside a class declaration, but outside the bodies of the class's method declarations

## Manipulating Instance Variables with Methods
```java
public class GradeBook {
  private String courseName;

  // method to set the course name
  public void setCourseName(String name) {
    courseName = name;
  }
  
  // method to retrieve the course name
  public String getCourseName() {
    return courseName;
  }
}
```

## Access Modifiers
Most instance variables are declared to be `private for data hiding`. Variables (or methods) ceclared to be private are accessible only to methods of the class in which they are declared
```java
public class GradeBook {
  private String courseName;

  public void setCourseName(String name) {
    courseName = name;
  }
  
  public String getCourseName() {
    return courseName;
  }
}
```

## Using Getter and Setter
```java
public class GradeBook {
  private String courseName;

  public void setCourseName(String name) {
    courseName = name;
  }
  
  public String getCourseName() {
    return courseName;
  }
  
  public void displayMessage() {
    System.out.println("Welcome to the grade book for " + getCourseName());
  }
}
```
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class GradeBookTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    GradeBook myGradeBook = new GradeBook();
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter course name:");
    String theName = input.nextLine();
    myGradeBook.setCourseName(theName);
    System.out.println();
    myGradeBook.displayMessage();
  }
}
```

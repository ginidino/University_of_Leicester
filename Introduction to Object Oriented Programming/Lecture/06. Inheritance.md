# Inheritance
* A form of software reuse in which a new calss is created by sbsorbing an existing class's members and embellishing them with new or modified capabilites
* Can save time during program development by basing new classes on existing high-quality software
* Increases the likelihood that a system can be implemented and maintained effectively
* When creating a class, rather than declaring completely new members, you can designate that the new class should inherit the members of an existing class
  - Existing class is the superclass
  - New class is the subclass
* Each subclass can be a superclass of future subcalsses, forming a class hierarchy
* A `subclass` can add its own fields and methods
* A `subclass` is more specific than its `superclass` and represents a more specialized group of objects
* The `subclass` exhibits the behaviors of its `supperclass` and can add behaviors that are specific to the `subclass`
  - This is why inheritance is sometimes referred to as `specialization`
* The direct superclass is the superclass from which the subclass explicitly inherits 
* An indirect superclass is any class above the direct superclass in the class hierarchy

## Inheritance vs. Composition
* Inheritance: Is-a relationship between classes
  - In an *is-a* relationship, an object of a subclass can also be treated as an object of its superclass 
* Composition: Has-a relationship between classes
  - In a *has-a* relationship, an object contains references to other objects as members

### More Examples and Observations
|**Supperclass**|**Subclass**|
|:---|:---|
|Student|GraduateStudent, UndergraduateStudent|
|Shape|Circle, Triangle, Rectangle, Sphere, Cube|
|Loan|CarLoan, HomeImprovementLoan, MortgageLoan|
|Employee|Faculty, Staf|
|BankAccount|CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount|
* `Superclasses` tend to be "more general" and `subclasses` "more specific"
* Because every subclass object is an object of its `superclass`, and one `superclass` can have many `subclasses`, the set of objects represented by a `superclass` is typically larger than the set of objects represented by any of its `subclasses`

## Class Hierarchy (Inheritance Hierarchy)
* A `superclass` exists in a hierarchical relationship with its `subclasses`

  <img width="548" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 3 17 23 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94044443/235465645-186b1b7f-f1de-457c-ad8c-282853823cd9.png">

* Each arrow in the hierarchy represents an is-a relationship
* Follow the arrows upward in the class hierarchy
  - A *Teacher* is a *Faculty* (also an *Employee*, a *CommunityMember*)
* *CommunityMember* is the direct superclass of *Employee, Student* and *Alumnus* and is an indirect superclass of all the other classes

## Superclass and Subclass
* Objects of all classes that extend a common superclass can be treated as objects of that superclass(e.g., java.lang.Object)
  - Commonality expressed in the members of the superclass
* Inheritance issue:
  - `A subclass can inherit methods that it does not need or should not have` 
  - Even shen a superclass method is appropriate for a subclass, that subclass often needs a customized version of the method
  - The subclass can **override** (redefine) the superclass method with an appropriate implementation (there will be an example later)

## public and private Members
* A class's public members are accessible wherever the program has a reference to an object of that class or one of its subclasses
* A class's private members are accessible only within the class itself (invisible to subclasses)

## protected Members
* `protected` access is an intermediate access level between pubilc and private
* A superclass's protected members can be accessed by:
  - members of that supercalss
  - members of its subclasses
  - members of other classes in the same package 
* All `public` and `protected` superclass members retain their original access modifier when they become members of the subclass
* `A superclass's private members are hidden in its subclasses`
  - They can be accessed only through the public or protected methods inherited from the superclass 
* Subclass methods can refer to public and protected members inherited from the superclass simply by using the member names
* When a subclass method overrides an inherited superclass method, the superclass method can be accessed from the subclass by preceding the superclass method name with keyword super and a dot (.) separator

### Case Study: A Payroll Application
* Suppose we need to create classes for two types of employees
  - Commission employees are paid a percentage of their sales (**ComissionEmployee**)
  - Base-salaried commission employees receive a base salary plus a percentage of their sales (**BasePlusCommissionEmployee**)

#### Comparing the Two Types
* Both classes need data fields to store the employee’s personal information (e.g., name, social security number)
* **Differences**:
  - **BasePlusCommissionEmployee** class needs one additional field to store the employee’s base salary
  - The way of calculating the earnings are different

#### Design Choice #1
Creating the tow classes independently

<img width="633" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 3 30 10 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94044443/235467733-f1e75564-f815-4279-8248-0af73689d5d5.png">

#### Problems of Design Choice #1
* Much of *BasePlusCommissionEmployee*’s code will be identical to that of *CommissionEmployee*
* For implementation, we will literally copy the code of the class *CommissionEmployee* and paste the copied code into the class *BasePlusCommissionEmployee*
  - `"Copy-and-paste" approach is often error prone`. It spreads copies of the same code throughout a system, creating code-maintenance nightmares

#### Design Choice #2
*BasePlusCommissionEmployee* extends *CommissionEmployee*

<img width="630" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 3 32 22 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94044443/235468053-85d9e7da-575a-4b46-8324-b812b5ffe3a5.png">

#### CommissionEmployee
```java
public class CommissionEmployee {
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private String socialSecurityNumber;
  private double grossSales;
  private double commissionRate;
  ...
}
```
A five-argument constructor
```java
public CommissionEmployee(String first, String last, String ssn, double sales, double rate) {
  firstName = first;
  lastName = last;
  socialSecurityNumber = ssn;
  setGrossSales(sales); // data validation
  setCommissionRate(rate); // data validation
}

public void setGrossSales(double sales) {
  grossSales = (sales < 0.0) ? 0.0 : sales;
}

public void setCommissionRate(double rate) {
  commissionRate = (rate > 0.0 && rate < 1.0) ? rate : 0.0;
}
```
Several other get and set methods
```java
public void setFirstName(String first) {
  firstName = first;
}

public String getFirstName() {
  return firstName;
}

public void setLastName(String last) {
  lastName = last;
}

public String getLastName() {
  return lastName;
}
....
```
Several other get and set methods
```java
public void setSocialSecurityNumber(String ssn) {
  socialSecurityNumber = ssn;
}

public String getSocialSecurityNumber() {
  return socialSecurityNumber;
}

public double getGrossSales() {
  return grossSales;
}

public double getCommissionRate() {
  return commissionRate;
}
```
Calculation and string transformation methods
```java
public double earnings() {
  return commissionRate * grossSales;
}

@Override
public String toString() {
  return String.format("%s: %s %s\n%s: %s\n%s: %.2f\n%s: %.2f", "commission employee", firstName, lastName, "social security number", socialSecurityNumber, "gross sales", grossSales, "commission rate", commissionRate);
}
```

#### Overriding toString() Method
* `toString()` is one of the methods that every class inherits directly or indirectly from class Object
  - Returns a String that "textually represents" an object
  - Called implicitly whenever an object must be converted to a String representation (e.g., System.out.println(objRef))
* Class Object’s `toString()` method returns a String that includes the name of the object’s class.
  - If not overridden, returns something like "CommissionEmployee@70dea4e" (the part after @ is the hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object)
  - This is primarily a placeholder that can be overridden by a subclass to specify customized String representation
* To override a superclass’s method, a subclass must declare a method with the same signature as the superclass method
* The access level of an overriding method can be higher, but not lower than that of the overridden method (package-private < protected < public)
* @Override annotation.
  - Optional, but helps the compiler to ensure that the method has the same signature as the one in the superclass
  ```java
  @Override
  public String toString() { 
    ... 
  }
  ```

#### CommissionEmployee 
```java
public class BasePlusCommissionEmployee extends CommissionEmployee {
  private double baseSalary; // Added a new field

  public BasePlusCommissionEmployee(String first, String last, String ssn, double sales, double rate, double salary) {
    // Its own constructor. In Java, constructors are not class members and are not
    // inherited by subclasses
    super(first, last, ssn, sales, rate);
    setBaseSalary(salary);
  }
  
  public void setBaseSalary(double salary) {
    baseSalary = (salary < 0.0) ? 0.0 : salary;
  }
  .....
}
```
Overriding the two inherited methods for customized behaviors
```java
public class BasePlusCommissionEmployee extends CommissionEmployee {

  public double earnings() {
    return baseSalary + (commissionRate * grossSales);
  }
  
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return String.format("%s: %s %s\n%s: %s\n%s: %.2f\n%s: %.2f\n%s: %.2f", "base-salaried", firstName, lastName, "social security number", socialSecurityNumber, "gross sales", grossSales, "commission rate", commissionRate, "base salary", baseSalary);
  }
}
```
#### Subclass Constructors
* Each constructor in the subclass needs to invoke a superclass constructor for object construction (e.g., to initialize inherited instance variables) by using the `super` keyword
* If this is not explicitly done, the compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the superclass. `If the super class does not have a no-argument constructor, you will get a compile-time error`
* **Constructor chaining**: If a subclass constructor invokes a constructor of its superclass, there will be a whole chain of constructors called, all the way back to the constructor of Object. You need to be aware of its effect

#### Accessing fields of superclass
* A subclass inherits all public and protected members of its parent, no matter what package the subclass is in
  - These members are directly accessible in the subclass
* If the subclass is in the same package as its parent, it also inherits the parent’s *package-private* members (those without access level modifiers)
  - These members are directly accessible in the subclass
* A subclass does not inherit the private members. Private fields need to be accessed using the methods (public, protected, or package-private ones) inherited from superclass
  
#### Recall the Access Level Modifiers
|**Modifier**|**Class**|**Package**|**Subclass**|**World**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|public|Y|Y|Y|Y|
|protected|Y|Y|Y|N|
|no_modifier|Y|Y|N|N|
|private|Y|N|N|N|
> Note that this is for controlling access to class members. At the top level, a class can only be declared as public or package-private (no explicit modifier)

#### More on the super Keyword
* Two main usage scenarios
* The super keyword can be used to invoke a superclass’s constructor (as illustrated by our earlier example)
* If your method overrides its superclass’s method, you can invoke the overridden method using the keyword super

```java
public class BasePlusCommissionEmployee extends CommissionEmployee {
  
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return String.format("%s: %s %s\n%s: %s\n%s: %.2f\n%s: %.2f\n%s: %.2f", "base-salaried", firstName, lastName, "social security number", socialSecurityNumber, "gross sales", grossSales, "commission rate", commissionRate, "base salary", baseSalary);
  }
}

public class BasePlusCommissionEmployee extends CommissionEmployee {
 
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return String.format("%s %s\n%s: %.2f", "base-salaried", super.toString(), "base salary", getBaseSalary());
  }
}
```
#### Using CommissionEmployee class
```java
public class CommissionEmployeeTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		CommissionEmployee employee = new CommissionEmployee("Sue", "Jones", "111-1122-223-222", 1000, 6);
		System.out.println("Employee information are :");
		System.out.println("First Name: "+employee.getFirstName());
		System.out.println("Last Name: "+employee.getLastName());
		System.out.println("Social security number is :"+employee.getSocialSecurityNumber());
		System.out.println("Gross sales is :"+employee.getGrossSales());
		System.out.println("Commission rate: "+ employee.getCommissionRate());
		employee.setGrossSales(500);
		employee.setCommissionRate(0.1);
		System.out.println("Updated employee information obtaind by toString:\n\n"+employee);
	}
}
```
Output
```
Employee information are :
First Name: Sue
Last Name: Jones
Social security number is :111-1122-223-222
Gross sales is :1000.0
Commission rate: 0.0
Updated employee information obtaind by toString:
commission employee: Sue Jones
social security number: 111-1122-223-222
gross sales: 500.00
commission rate: 0.10
```

#### Using BasePlusCommissionEmployee class
```java
public class BasePlusCommissionEmployeeTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BasePlusCommissionEmployee employee = new BasePlusCommissionEmployee("Sue", "Jones", "111-1122-223-222", 1000, 0.4,300);
		System.out.println("Employee information are :");
		System.out.println("First Name: "+employee.getFirstName());
		System.out.println("Last Name: "+employee.getLastName());
		System.out.println("Social security number is :"+employee.getSocialSecurityNumber());
		System.out.println("Gross sales is :"+employee.getGrossSales());
		System.out.println("Commission rate: "+ employee.getCommissionRate());
		System.out.println("Base salary is: "+employee.getBaseSalary());
		employee.setBaseSalary(1000);
		System.out.println("Updated employee information obtaind by toString:\n\n"+employee);
	}
}
```
Output
```
Employee information are :
First Name: Sue
Last Name: Jones
Social security number is :111-1122-223-222
Gross sales is :1000.0
Commission rate: 0.4
Base salary is: 300.0
Updated employee information obtaind by toString:
base-salaried commission employee: Sue Jones
social security number: 111-1122-223-222
gross sales: 1000.00
commission rate: 0.40
base salary: 1000.00
```

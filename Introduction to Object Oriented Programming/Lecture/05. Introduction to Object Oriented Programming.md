# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

# static Class Members
* Recall that every object of a class has its own copy of all the instance variables of the class
  - Instance variables represnet conceptsthat are unique per instance, e.g., name in class Student
*  In certain cases, only one copy of a particular variable should be shared by all objects of a class (e.g., a counter that keeps track of every object created for memory management).
  - A staic field-called a class variable is used in such cases
* A staic variable represents classwide information. All objects of the class share the same piece of data
* Example:
```java
public class Employee {
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private static int count; // number of employees created
}
```
* staic class members are available as soon as the class is loaded into memory at execution time (objects may not exist yet)
* A class's `public static` members can be accessed through a reference to any object of the class, or by qualifying the member name with the class name and a dot(.), e.g., Math.PI
* A class's `private static` members can be accessed by client code only through methods of the class
* Example
```java
public class EmployeeTest { ...
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Employee e = new Employee();
    System.out.println("# employees = " + e.count); // not encouraged
    System.out.println("# employees = " + Employee.count); // good practice
  }
}
```
```java
public class Employee {
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private static int count; // number of employees created
  
  public static int getCount() {
    return count;
  }
}
```
```java
public class EmployeeTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("# employees = "+ Employee.getCount());
  }
}
```

* A static method cannot access non-static class members (e.g., instance variables), because a static method can be called even when no objects of the class have been instantiated
* For the same reason, the this reference cannot be used in a static method
* If a static variable is not initialized, the compiler assigns it a default value (e.g.,s 0 for int)

### Example
```java
public class Employee {
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private static int count; // number of employees created
  
  public Employee(String first, String last) {
    firstName = first;
    lastName = last;
    ++count;
    System.out.println("Employee constructor: "+count +" = " + firstName + " " + lastName);
  }
  
  public String getFirstName() {
    return firstName;
  }
  
  public String getLastName() {
    return lastName;
  }
  
  public static int getCount() {
    return count;
  }
}
```
```java
public class EmployeeTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Employees before instantiation: = " + Employee.getCount());
    Employee e1 = new Employee("Bob", "Blue");
    Employee e2 = new Employee("Susan", "Baker");
    System.out.println("Employees after instantiation:");
    System.out.println("via e1.getCount(): " + e1.getCount());
    System.out.println("via e2.getCount(): " + e2.getCount());
    System.out.println("via Employee.getCount(): "+ Employee.getCount());
    System.out.println("Employee 1: " + e1.getFirstName() + " "+e2.getFirstName() + "\nEmployee 2: " + e1.getLastName() + " " + e2.getLastName());
  }
}
```
Output
```
Employees before instantiation: = 0
Employee constructor: 1 = Bob Blue
Employee constructor: 2 = Susan Baker
Employees after instantiation:
via e1.getCount(): 2
via e2.getCount(): 2
via Employee.getCount(): 2
Employee 1: Bob Susan
Employee 2: Blue Baker
```

# *final* Instance Variables
* The principle of least privilege is fundamental to good software engineering
  - Code should be granted only the amount of privilege and access that it needs to accomplish its designated task, but no more
  - Makes your programs more robust by preventing code from accidentally (or maliciously) modifying variable values and calling methods that should not be accessible
* The keyword final specifies that a variable is not modifiable(i.e., constant) and any attempt to modify leads to an error (cannot compile)
  ```java
  private final int INCREMENT;
  ```
* final variables can be initialized when they are declared
* If they are not, they must be initialized in every constructor of the class
* Initializing fianl variable in constructors enables each object of the class to have a different value for the constant
* If a final variable is not initialized when it is declared or in every constructor, the program will not compile

# Creating Packages
* Each class in the Java API belongs to package that contains a group of related classes
* Packages help programmers organize application components
* Packages facilitate software reuse by enabling programs to import classes from other packages, rather than copying the classes into each program that uses them
* Packages provide a convention for unique class names, which helps prevent class-name conflicts

## Declaring a reusable class
1. Step 1: Declare a public class (to be reusable)
2. Step 2: Choose a package name and add a package declaration to the source file for the reusable class declaration
  - In each Java source file there can be only one package declaration, and it must precede all other declarations and statements
```java
package co1105;
public class Time {
  private int hour; // 0 - 23
  private int minute; // 0 - 59
  private int second; // 0 - 59
  //...
}
```

## Creating Packages
* A Java source file must have the following order
  - a package declaration
  - import declarations
  - class declarations (you can declare multiple classes in one .java file)
* Only one of the class declarations in a .java file can be public
* Other classes in the file are placed in the package and can be used only by the other classes in the package. Non-public classes are in a package to support the reusable classes in the package
* When a Java file containing a package declaration is compiled, the resulting class file is placed in the directory specified by the declaration
* The class `Time` should be placed in the directory `co1105`

## Package Access
* If no access modifier is specified for a class member when itâ€™s declared in a class, it is considered to have package access.

```java
public class Time1 {
  private int hour;
  private int minute;
  private int second;

  public void setTime(int h, int m, int s) {
  ...
  }
}
```

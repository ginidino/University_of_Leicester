# Linear Data Structure
* The data structure where data items are organized sequentially or linearly where data elements attached one after another is called linear data structure
* Data elements in a liner data structure are traversed one after the other and only one element can be directly reached while traversing
* All the data items in linear data structure can be traversed in single run
* There are two techniques of representing such linear structure within memory
* The first way is to provide the linear relationships among all the elements represented using linear memory location. These linear structures are termed as arrays
* The second technique is to provide the linear relationship among all the elements represented by using the concept of pointers or links. These linear structues are termed as linked lists

## Common Example of Linear Data Structure
* Arrays
* Queues
* Stacks
* Linked Lists

## Non Linear Data Structure
* These are the data structures in which there is no sequential linking of data elements
* Any pair or group of data elements can be linked to each other and can be accessed without a strict sequence
* All the data elements in non linear data structure can not be traversed in single run
  * Binary Tree
  * Heap
  * Graph

## Python Specific Data Structure
Python comes with a general set of built in data structures:
* lists
* tuples
* string
* dictionaries
* sets
* others...

# Week2

## Question1
Write a program that generates and prints some random numbers using the `random.random()` command. What values are generated by this command?

Code
```py
import random

random.random()
```

Output
```
0.25706536712534533
```

# Question2
Write a program that simulates an unbiased coin flip. Your program should print true if the coin flip results in a head and false if the coin flip results in a tail.
> Hint: any value greater than 0.5, represents Head otherwise it represents Tail

Code
```py
import random

flip = random.random()
print(flip)

if flip > 0.5:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
```
Output
```
0.607362178343562
True
```

# Question3
Now consider a biased coin. Write a program that takes a value p , with range between 0 and 1, as input from the user and then get a random number between 0 and 1 which simulate the coin flip similar to the previous program. If value p is greater than generated random number, print head otherwise print Tail. 

Code
```py
import random

p = float(input("Enter the value with range between 0 and 1: "))

flip = random.random()
print(flip)

if p > flip:
    print("Head")
else:
    print("Tail")
```

Output
```
Enter the value with range between 0 and 1: 0.345
0.7583745861539328
Tail
```

# Question4
Make an annoying number guessing game.
> Hint: you may generate the target value using a random number. 

Code
```py
import random

guessNum = random.randint(0, 100)

num = int(input("Enter the number: "))

if guessNum == num:
    print("Correct")
elif guessNum < num:
    print("guess is low")
else:
    print("geuss is high")
```

Output
```
Enter the number: 37
guess is low
```

# Question5
Write a program to get a student mark, as an input from user and print its grade based on the following criteria:

* if mark>=80 print 'A'
* if mark between 70-80 print 'B'
* if mark between 60-70 print 'C'
* if mark between 50-60 print 'D'
* if mark < 50 print 'F'

Code
```py
grade = int(input("Enter the grade: "))

if grade < 0 or grade > 100:
    print("invalid grade")
elif grade >= 80:
    print("A")
elif 70 <= grade < 80:
    print("B")
elif 60 <= grade < 70:
    print("C")
elif 50 <= grade < 60:
    print("C")
else:
    print("F")
```

Output
```
Enter the grade: 70
B
```

# Question6
Write a program to get an integer number from user (num1), the number must be an even number between 10 and 50; if not, then your program should end by displaying a message to the user to try again with the correct value. If the user entered a right value, your program should then generate a random number between 10 to 100. If the generated number is divisible by 7, and then if the first number (num1) is greater or equivalent than the generated random number, add them and display the result, otherwise get them multiplied and display the output.

> Hint: you must use only random.randint(), do NOT use randrange for this exercise..

Code
```py
import random

num1 = int(input("Enter the even number between 10 and 50: "))

if num1 % 2 != 0 and (num1 < 10 or num1 > 50):
    print("try again with the correct value.")
else:
    ranNum = random.randint(10, 100)
    print("Random number is %d" % ranNum)
    
    result = 0
    if num1 % 7 == 0 and num1 > ranNum:
        result = num1 + ranNum
        print("%d + %d = %d" % (num1, ranNum, result))
    else:
        result = num1 * ranNum
        print("%d * %d = %d" % (num1, ranNum, result))
```

Output
```
Enter the even number between 10 and 50: 35
Random number is 20
35 + 20 = 55
```
